# Customer_Churn_Prediction
A telecom churn prediction project using PySpark’s MLlib. We processed and analyzed customer data, trained models like Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees, and evaluated them using cross-validation. Gradient Boosted Trees achieved 92.05% accuracy. This project showcases scalable churn prediction with big data tools.
